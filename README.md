# Autonio - A TechCrunch + Vivatech 2018 Hackathon project

How autonomous vehicles can preserve the mobility of seniors. #TechCrunch #Vivatech #Hackathon

We've created a service using Renault's autonomous driving cars as an answer to the urging problem of isolation of the elderly.

## Painpoints we were searching for the answer

* Social isolation of seniors (60+) is real public health issue
* The main cause is the loss of independence autonomy which also comes with the deteorization of health
* As the consequence of the limits of their body mentally or physically the elders get bored and anxious about themselves
* They afraid to find new hobbies and their old connections are mostly disappears with time
* They also proud and with dignity so don't ask permission from the family or help, they don't want to pull back their relatives
