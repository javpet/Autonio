# Autonio - A TechCrunch + Vivatech 2018 Hackathon project

How autonomous vehicles from Renault can preserve the mobility of seniors. #TechCrunch #Vivatech #Hackathon #Renault

We've created a service using Renault's autonomous driving cars as an answer to the urging problem of isolation of the elderly.

## Painpoints we were searching for the answer

* Social isolation of seniors (60+) is real public health issue
* The main cause is the loss of independence and autonomy which also comes with the deterioration of health
* As the consequence of the limits of their body mentally or physically the elders get bored and anxious about themselves
* They afraid to find new hobbies and their old connections are mostly disappears with time
* They also proud and with dignity so don't ask permission from the family or help, they don't want to pull back their relatives

## Steps inside of the application

Our persona: Maggie is 75 years old widow without serious health issues. She has a really outgoing personality, but since her husband passed away, she struggles to find the way to meet with her old friends or to attend her favorite pottery workshops nearby the city.

1.  Maggie receives a notification on her phone with a new "experience" available through Autonio / Opening the web app as a regular user

2.  After tapping on the notification Maggie finds herself on the experience page, where she can get details of the timing, duration, and also who is else might joining the same ride with the Renault autonomous car, to attend the workshop

3.  Maggie is kinda fear to meet new people so soon, so she is inviting her friend Paula from the other village which is also on the way to the workshop

4.  After confirming the order of the service through Autonio, Renault sends the autonomous driving car at the given time of the workshop, and Maggie can follow the route of the car on the dedicated map

5.  Later Maggie can also set reminders for herself, to not forget the event happening. Don't forget she is 75 years old!
